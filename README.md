Summary: 

This project is about the world's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, GDP growth rates, and GDP purchasing power parity (PPP), where the purpose of the project is to analyse each indicator from the year 1980 to 2023, and also to do predictions for the next years of 2024 and 2025.

Also in one second part, to do the prediction of the GDP per capita, but using other type of data, as for example the number of phone lines by habitants, literacy, and others.

To finish i wil do a comparison between the first and second predictions of 2024.


Data Sources:

For this project I used 4 datasets from Kaggle:

-World GDP Growth from 1980-2023:

On this dataset we have the rates of growth for each country. 

-World GDP Per Capita from 1980-2023:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/malayvyas/world-gdp-forecast-2023

On this dataset we have the gdp per capita of each country.

-World GDP Per Capita PPP (Purchasing Power Parity) from  1990-2019:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nitishabharathi/gdp-per-capita-all-countries

On this dataset we have the gdp ppp of eavh country 

-World GDP Per Capita and variables as Literacy, Phones, Birthrate, Deathrat, and others:
